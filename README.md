# **ARKEOLOG**

## The Cursed Depths Await

*Deep beneath the earth, forgotten tombs whisper of ancient treasures. You are an archaeologist who has descended into a procedurally-generated temple, armed only with a flickering torch and an insatiable greed for artifacts. But the darkness is alive and every relic you claim places a curse that upon your soul.*

**The deeper you go, the greater the treasures... and the heavier the curses.**


## **Story**

You've discovered an entrance to an ancient underground temple, rumored to hold priceless artifacts from a civilization lost to time. But these treasures are not freely given, each one carries a dark curse. Some curses dim your torch, making you vulnerable to the restless spirits that haunt these depths. Others slow your movements, cloud your vision, or even prevent your escape entirely.

The ghosts fear your torch's light, but as curses accumulate, your flame weakens and the ghosts gets bolder. Protection charms offer temporary respite from spectral attacks, but they are precious few. You must balance greed with survival: collect enough artifacts to make the expedition worthwhile, but retain enough strength to reach the extraction bucket and escape with your life and your fortune.


## **Goal**

Navigate into the procedurally-generated temple, collecting valuable artifacts (grails, rings, coins, weapons, skulls, and scepters) while managing the curses they inflict. Avoid or survive encounters with ghosts that stalk the shadows and traps around the temple. When you've gathered enough treasure or when the curses become too heavy to bear find the extraction bucket to escape and bank your gold. But beware: death means losing gold based on how deep you ventured.

**Will you escape with riches, or be forced to leave your loot behind?**
